Initial Layout:
===============

* Accept command line arguments to specify a video file to play ( can specify format of wallpaper center, fill, etc )
* Execute as a daemon
* Use ffmpeg or some other system to grab individual frames from video
* Use video information and time accordingly at a certain FPS to "play" the video by changing the background with each frame individually

There can be other approaches but this my initial idea

Other Proposals
===============
* Utilize mpv somehow
